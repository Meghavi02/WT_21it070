        extracurricular activities and encourage our students to actively
        participate in a range of activities. The campus has various student clubs
        and sports facilities to ensure a comprehensive learning environment. Gone
        are the days when the sport was viewed as just a fitness activity. Apart
        from physical strength, it builds discipline, confidence, team spirit, and
        accountability. With this in view, sporting events are a priority at Nitte
        and the University has dedicated teams for various events which compete in
        inter-college and intra-college competitions.
